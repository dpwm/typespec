# Typespec

Compile-time type-safe run-time type library for OCaml.

Use cases:
 * Serialization
 * Deserialization
 * Defaults

Works with records, tuples and arbitrary (custom) types using easy-to-write converters.

## Motivation

This library came about on a personal project that saw the benefits of OCaml and bucklescript, but resulted in a large amount of time being spent in writing serializers and de-serializers.
